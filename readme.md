This script makes it easy to sync an Enpass database between iOS/macOS and Windows devices.

## Getting Started

This is a simple script made for both private and business users that adopt Enpass Password Manager.

It is created to allow users to sync their password database between multiple Cloud services. In particular it makes it easy to sync an Enpass database between iOS/macOS and Windows devices.

It works with every version of Enpass below V6. Starting from V6, iCloud is supported by default on each platform.

Many users, especially the business ones, are not able to upgrade to Enpass V6 for various reasons. This script could be of help to all of them.

It is written in Python, hence I recommend to use it on a desktop environment. Tested on Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 and macOS 10.14. However it is meant for a Windows environment, of course.
